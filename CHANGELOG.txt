v1.3.0rc0
- Change to process group for better killing of multi-process chrome
- Add argument to Session/Target `send_command(..., *, with_perf: bool)` to
  return timing information about browser write/read.
- Update default chrome from 135.0.7011.0/1418433 to 144.0.7527.0/1544685
- Fix: New chrome takes longer/doesn't populate targets right away, so add a
  retry loop to populate targets
- Alter `get_chrome` verbose to print whole JSON
- Change chrome download path to use XDG cache dir
- Don't download chrome if we already have that version: add force argument
- Remove unused system inspection code
- Add a set of helper functions to await for tab loading and send javascript
v1.2.1
- Use custom threadpool for functions that could be running during shutdown:
  Python's stdlib threadpool isn't available during interpreter shutdown, nor
  `atexit`- so they cannot be started or shutdown during `atexit`, or relied
  upon at all. We use a custom threadpool during `Browser.close()` so that it
  can be leveraged during atexit, and now we use it during `Browser.open()`
  since certain use patterns have that function running during shutdown.

- Organize functions internally
- Improve choreo_diagnose
- Add Roadmap
- Bump logistro dependency
